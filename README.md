## About

### Me
A student from College of Humanities, Guangzhou University.  
In 2016 I met `GitHub`&reg; and had a lot of fun.  

### This Repository
- a whiteboard for all my projects and repositories.
- a guest-book on which you can write some issues or stuff.

## Boring stuff 

### A List of Git Commands for Newbies (Markdown)
[The list.](https://github.com/AquaJerry/hello-world/blob/master/gitCmdsList.md)  
Something like 'git add "file name"' and 'git commit -m "message"'. Will that remind you of your first time when using git?
