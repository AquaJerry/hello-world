### 0.1 About The Owner
The username of owner is AquaJerry.

Born in 20c 90s, he had never been exposed to the git until 2016 when he was a student from College of Humanities, Guangzhou University(in P.R.China) who happened to found how amazing GNU/Linux is in a school project. 

Then interested in `open-source` and `GNU/Linux`, AquaJerry, wanted to make an appeal to schoolmates to go away from Microsoft&reg; MFC games which he thought a group of endless devils.

### 0.2 About This Repository
The name of this repository is hello-world.

* a billboard for all owner's projects and repositories.
* a guest-book on which you can write some issues and stuff to the owner and maybe your name will appear in acknwledgments.
