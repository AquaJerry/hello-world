### 0.1 About Me
I'm a student from College of Humanities, Guangzhou University(in P.R.China). 

In 2016 I met `GitHub`&reg; and had a lot of fun, esp. interested in `open-source` and `GNU/Linux`. 

### 0.2 About This Repository
- a whiteboard for all my projects and repositories.
- a guest-book on which you can write some issues or stuff and then maybe your name will appear in acknwledgments.

## 1 Plan 

### 1.0 Personal Page (HTML5/CSS3 JS) (Mobile)
[Git address](https://github.com/aquajerry/aquajerry.github.io).

It mainly imitate the skin of WeChat, __Weui__.

### 1.1 Online Input Method for Chinese Wubi (JS JSON) (Mobile)
It's a shape-based IME with a standard ASCII keyboard. I've been meaning to find something useful from __Rime__.

For more info, see "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_input_methods_for_computers".

### 1.2 A List of Git Commands for Newbies (Markdown)
[The List.](https://github.com/AquaJerry/hello-world/blob/master/gitCmdsList.md)

Something like 'git add "file name"' and 'git commit -m "message"'. Will that remind you of your first time when using git?

## 2 Accomplishment
Coming soon :)
