## About

__Me__

A student from College of Humanities, Guangzhou University.  
In 2016 I met `GitHub`&reg; and had a lot of fun.  

__This Repository__

- a whiteboard for all my projects and repositories.
- a guest-book on which you can write something.

## Boring stuff

- [A List of Git Commands for Newbies](git-cheetsheet.md)

Something like 'git add "file name"' and 'git commit -m "message"'.
Will that remind you of your first time when using git?

- [An intro of digital abstraction from Harris](bit-harris.md)

Abstracion makes life easier.
To know what is in an abstraction makes someone know how to make life easier.
