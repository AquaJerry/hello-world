## abstract & concrete

- Abstraction makes life easier!
- Knowing what's behind abstraction makes you know how to make life easier!

## what's computing

- Every computer can do the same things as every others.
- Slower computer will just take longer.
- Translations can be done automatically by every computer.

## analog & digital

- It's hard to improve the accuracy of analog machines.
- Digital machines that are programmable are universal.

## properties of algorithms

- definiteness
	- enough info
- effective computability
	- virified
- finiteness
	- time limit

## higher level lang than machine

- fewer instructions
- easier read
- less efficiently

## isa

- operand
- data type
- addressing mode

## isa & microarch

- design with isa that is 'visible'
- implement with microarch that is 'invisible'
- An ISA can be implemented with different microarches.
- Changes on microarch generally won't affect isa for backword compatibility.

## comments

- If phrased in a way that is definite and lacks amibiguity,
    natural language can express algorithms.
- Different ISAs are capable of solving the same problems.
